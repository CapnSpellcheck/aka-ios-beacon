# AKA Commons

AKA Commons is a library of reusable components. 

## Status

The library is missing proper documentation and is only partially tested. There are some quite useful gems included that are worth being reused, but I did not yet have time to clean up the library, complete unit tests or documentation, so if you are interested in using AKACommons, please consider reading the source and testing the functionality you need.

Contributions are most welcome ;-)

## License

AKACommons uses a standard 2-clause BSD License, which means that you have to mention me as the original author of this code and reproduce the LICENSE text inside your App. If you have a problem with this attribution requirement, please contact me.
