/**
 Enumerates potential binding targets owned or otherwise referenced from this object. This is used by binding controllers to traverse object graphs and locate binding expressions in order to create appropriate bindings for them.

 The default implementation enumerates the table view's tableHeaderView and tableFooterView. Table view cells as well as section headers and footers are not enumerated because they are data driven. Bindings for these will be created dynamically by child binding controllers.

 @param block bindingTarget is the potential binding target, stop can be assigned YES to instruct the enumeration to stop.
