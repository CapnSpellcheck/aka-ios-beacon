/**
 Enables binding support for the specified viewController by creating a binding bahvior instance suitable for the specified view controller and adding it as child view controller.

 Bindings will use the viewController as data context.

 If the viewController conforms to the AKABindingBehaviorDelegate protocol, it will be used as delegate.

 This should be called from the viewDidLoad: method of the viewController to ensure that the viewController's view hierarchy is loaded and that the behavior will receive life cycle events that trigger binding initializations. If the behavior is added after the viewController's viewWillAppear: or viewDidAppear: methods have been called before, the behavior will not initialize and activate bindings, and would require you to call its life cycle methods manually to update its life cycle state.

 @param viewController  the view controller also serving as binding data context and delegate (if it's conforming to AKABindingBehaviorDelegate).

 Observes changes of the target's key path and calls the specified block whenever a change occurs.

 The observation will be activated when the view controller appears (by binding behavior's viewWillAppear)
 and will be deactivated when it disappears (binding behavior's viewWillDisappear).

 The AKAProperty returned is owned by the binding behavior. You can keep a reference to the property
 and manually call startObservingChanges or stopObservingChanges to control individual observations.

 You can also remove the observation using the removeObservation: method.

 @param didChangeValue the change observer block
