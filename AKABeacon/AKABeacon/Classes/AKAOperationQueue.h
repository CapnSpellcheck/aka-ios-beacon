/**
 The delegate of an `AKAOperationQueue` can respond to `AKAOperation` lifecycle
 events by implementing these methods.

 In general, implementing `ALAOperationQueueDelegate` is not necessary; you would
 want to use an `AKAOperationObserver` instead. However, there are a couple of
 situations where using `AKAOperationQueueDelegate` can lead to simpler code.
 For example, `AKAGroupOperation` is the delegate of its own internal
 `AKAOperationQueue` and uses it to manage dependencies.
